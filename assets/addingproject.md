## **Add project details.**

On the same screen, add a README file (a text file that describes your project, and a best practice in development), a .gitignore (which removes irrelevant files like .DS_Store), and a license for your project.

These details make it easier for collaborators to understand your project and any guidelines youâ€™d like them to follow.
