## **Create a local copy of your repository.**

You’ll now create a local copy of your GitHub repository (or in GitHub terms, "clone" your repository) where you’ll edit your files and push your changes. On your main repository page, click the green Code button, then copy the HTTPS URL of your repository.

You already have a copy of your project on your hard drive, so why do you need to clone your repository? This is a best practice because it makes it easy to see when people added or removed files. It also makes it easier to fix merge conflicts.
